The main entry point is [src/demo_fastapi/main.py](mdc:src/demo_fastapi/main.py), which configures and creates the FastAPI application instance using a factory function.

Project configuration is located at [src/demo_fastapi/core/config.py](mdc:src/demo_fastapi/core/config.py), managed by Pydantic's settings.

## Key Features

- ORM database operations using SQLAlchemy
- Configuration management using Pydantic-Settings
- Modular API structure based on routers
- User authentication and authorization functionality
- Demonstration of asynchronous task processing
- Examples of many-to-many relationships

## API Structure
